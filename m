Hi,

please consider applying patches that are chained to this message.

They make getting/enabling the clocks in the etnaviv driver slightly nicer,
first two also fix potential problems.

Compared to v1, patch 2/4 was fixed and patch 3/4 was added.

As it was pointed out in response to v1, the clocks documented as
mandatory by the binding document are different from what the driver
enforces. Moreover, there is no agreement on which clocks must be
present in the device tree, so I'm leaving the binding document until
it's cleared up.

In any case, the "core" clock is always present so it's safe to make it
mandatory and regardless of what ends up happening to the binding
documentation, the other clocks can't be enforced without regressions.
At most a comment or a warning could be added. I'm leaving it as it is.

Thank you
Lubo
